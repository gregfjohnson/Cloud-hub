Introduction
</h3>
</a>

<p>
This is an implementation of wireless mesh networks.  It is intended
to be a firmware upgrade for inexpensive wireless routers such as the
Linksys WRT54G.  The idea is to make it easy to build up wireless coverage
throughout large homes, office buildings, and multiple-building campuses
by setting up inexpensive routers that will configure themselves into
optimal wireless meshes.  Clients can then gain access to the internet
either by attaching cat-5 cable to one of the boxes, or by joining
the mesh as an "ad-hoc leaf node" which requires no special software
or drivers.

<p>
Cloud hub is a link-level implementation, meant to be thought of as a single
large "ethernet hub".

<p>
From the user's perspective, a hub is a simple device:  plug it in,
and then attach cat-5 cables to it.

<p>
The goal of the cloud hub project is to make a wireless mesh close to
this level of simplicity:

<p>
Get a new wireless box, install the cloud hub firmware, plug it in, and
it finds your other cloud hub boxes by itself.  Connect your computer to
it with a cat-5 cable, or set your computer's wifi card to ad-hoc mode,
and you're done.  (Well, almost.  If you want, you can access a simple
internal configuration web page and set wifi parameters such as SSID
and WEP to your preferences.)

<p>
Configuration, to the extent that it is necessary, is uncluttered
and simple.

<p>
This project represents an experiment in system design philosophy: Do just
one task, and do it in a simple, clean, understandable, and reliable way.
Have different boxes do different things.  This firmware provides a
simple, clean and minimal configuration web interface.  A collection
of routers with this firmware collectively implement a single collision
domain.  The individual cloud boxes do not have IP addresses.  In cloud
mode, the boxes do not provide DHCPD service; have another box do that.
No firewalls; have another box do that.  No NAT; have another box do that.
(Maybe have a single non-cloud server box, or even your DSL/cable modem,
do all of these things.)  Cloud hub provides a single conceptually simple
service: a collision domain implemented wirelessly over an extended area.

<p>
Use Cat-5 cable to connect one of your cloud boxes to a DSL or cable
modem, or a LAN that is connected to the internet.

<p>
The wireless routers continuously sense wireless signal strength.
They update their connectivity among themselves automatically to optimize
overall signal quality.

<p>
In addition to wireless connections, the cloud hub boxes sense each
other via cat-5 connections.  So, if you have more than one cloud hub
box that happens to be attached to your LAN, those boxes will find each
other that way and integrate with each other via the cat-5 connection.

<p>
The cloud hub software uses wifi ad-hoc mode.  It permits standard
unmodified ad-hoc devices to integrate into the mesh as leaf nodes.
In other words, you can use a wifi-equipped laptop computer or beige box
with a wifi card in it.  After configuring such a device into ad-hoc
mode, it will be integrated into the wireless mesh and gain access to
the network.

<p>
Ad hoc clients can roam throughout the mesh, and are dynamically handed
off to the nearest, best-signal cloud box.

<p>
The cloud boxes create a spanning tree of connections among themselves,
but make an effort to communicate parsimoniously to reduce wireless
traffic.  Additional non-local arcs are added to the graph in those cases
where signal quality permits it.  Each node has the responsibility to make
sure that its spanning-tree neighbors have messages propagated to them,
but if a node can construct a proof that its neighbor has the message
(having overheard it from some other box in the cloud), it will refrain
from redundantly transmitting it.

<p>
The internal web server has a display that shows a continuously updated
picture of the topology of the entire cloud.

<p>
The web server has a display of the wireless environment of the entire
cloud.  Each node monitors its immediate environment for other wifi
access points and activity.  About once per minute it transmits this
information throughout the cloud.  So, every cloud box can show the user
all of the wifi activity seen by every node throughout the cloud.

<p>
From the internal configuration web server of a single cloud box, it is
possible to update the wifi parameters of all of the boxes in the cloud.
(As a security check, this will only work for boxes that share the same
administrator password and current wifi parameters.)

<p>
Security is currently 64-bit or 128-bit WEP.

<p>
The indicator lights on the front of the WRT54G blink so as to provide
a handy picture of mesh status.  The lights on the front of a particular
WRT54G blink out the number of boxes in the cloud of which it is a member,
and how many of those boxes it can sense directly with adequate signal
strength.

<p>
In sum, the cloud hub project embodies few novel ideas for mesh networking
combined with attention to detail to create reliable, easy-to-deploy
wireless infrastructure.

Installing the firmware binary and getting started
</h3>
</a>

The firmware has been tested on the following versions of the Linksys
WRT54G.  It has not been tested on WRT54GS boxes, or routers from other
manufacturers.

<p>
NOTE:  This is experimental firmware.  The process of upgrading firmware
on the WRT54G is a bit sensitive.  It is possible to physically ruin a
WRT54G during a botched attempt to install new firmware.  Please understand
that you are assuming $70 worth of risk!  If you proceed despite this
warning, and fry your box, you have been warned.

<p>
With a lot of effort, it is usually possible to recover a WRT54G after a
botched firmware install, but it is a painful process.  Having said all
that, I have botched firmware installs several times, and have always
(fortunately) been able to recover the box.  The only time I completely
fried a WRT54G was when I accidentally plugged my laptop's power connector
into it.  (Identical, physically compatible plugs, but different voltages.
Go figure.)

<a name="upgrade">
<h4>
The firmware upgrade process
</h4>
</a>

<p>
First, download the latest cloud hub firmware:

<ul>
    <li>
    Browse to http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cloudhub

    <li>
    Hit the big green "Download Cloud Hub" button

    <li>
    Select "Release" cloud_hub_0.1.40

    <li>
    Select "cloud_hub_0.1.40.bin"

    <li>
    Save "cloud_hub_0.1.40.bin" to a convenient location on your computer
</ul>

<p>
Access the internal web page inside the router.  By default, the router
is at IP address 192.168.1.1, netmask 255.255.255.0.  So, you may have
to temporarily modify you PC's IP address so that it is in the 192.168.1
range, for example 192.168.10.

<p>
Make sure that you have a Cat-5 cable connected between your PC and one
of the four contiguous Cat-5 connections on the back of the WRT54G.

<p>
From your browser, go to "192.168.1.1".  You may be asked for a password.
If so, you can leave "User Name" blank, and type in the default password
"admin".

<p>
Assuming you are starting with Linksys firmware, select the "Administration"
page.

<p>
Select "Firmware Upgrade".  Select the "Browse" button, and navigate to
the firmware file "cloud_hub_0.1.40.bin" downloaded from this web site.

<p>
Hit the "Upgrade" button, and wait patiently.  (Not waiting long enough
during a firmware upgrade is the usual way to ruin a router.)  When
you get the "Upgrade is successful message, hit "Continue".

<p>
You should see the "Cloud hub initial setup" page at this point.

<a name="setup">
<h4>
Initial setup after the firmware upgrade
</h4>
</a>

<p>
Reset the box to factory default settings by pressing and holding down
the "reset" button on the back of the box, next to the fifth Cat-5
connection.  You will probably need a pen or some other pointed object
to get to the button, because it is recessed in a little bit.  You
have to hold the button down for 10 or 15 seconds, until the "Power"
light on the front of the box begins to blink rapidly.  Then, wait
a minute or so until the box reboots.

<p>
Select "Activate cloud hub", and while the router reboots, switch
the Cat-5 cable on the back of the router from one of the four contiguous
connections over to the fifth separate connection.  THIS IS IMPORTANT!
You have to do this in order to regain access to the internal web
page in the router!

<p>
With this firmware, the fifth connection is used exclusively for accessing
the internal configuration web page of the router, and for ssh access into
the router.  It is not used for connections to the internet etc.

<p>
The four contiguous connections on the router are used for communication
with other PC's, modems, the internet, etc.

<p>
If you care to, you can customize the wireless settings on your
router from the "Cloud hub setup" page.

<p>
With multiple routers configured as above, they will find each other and
exchange packets.  You can plug a Cat-5 connection into one of the four
contiguous connections on the back of the router.  Or, you can configure
a wireless card in your PC to ad-hoc mode, and with it find the SSID
and channel of your wireless cloud.  Either way, your PC will be on the
collision domain defined by the cloud of WRT54G routers.

<h3>
Building the firmware binary from source code
</h3>
</a>

<p>
The cloud hub firmware is built on top of tofu's modifications to
HyperWRT.  HyperWRT is in turn a set of modifications to the Linksys
WRT54G firmware.  The steps to build the firmware are to download Linksys
firmware, apply the HyperWRT/tofu changes, and then apply the cloud hub
firmware changes.  (The cloud hub changes are mostly to the internal web
page and the default non-volatile ram settings.)  Then, the cloud hub
user-land code is compiled and copied into the firmware build environment,
and the firmware is then built.  These steps are described below, with
chunks of Linux shell commands that can be cut and pasted.

<p>
(Cloud hub is a collection of user-land applications, and does
not involve modifications to the Linux kernel.  As such, it would be
possible without too much effort to port it to other Linux platforms.
In fact, when the project was started a few years ago it was built using
hostap, an open source wifi package for prism-based wifi cards.)

<p>
Get the Linksys firmware version WRT54GL_v4.30.1_DE.tgz.

<pre>
    mkdir ~/wrt_dir
    cd ~/wrt_dir
    ftp ftp.linksys.com
    Name (ftp.linksys.com:greg): anonymous
    Password: (your email address is conventional)
    ftp> cd opensourcecode/wrt54gl/4.30.1-DE
    ftp> get WRT54GL_v4.30.1_DE.tgz
    ftp> exit
</pre>

<p>
Unpack it:
<pre>
    tar xfz WRT54GL_v4.30.1_DE.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Become super-user so that you can write the the directory /opt,
and create a directory containing cross-compilation tools:

<pre>
    su
    Password:
    mv WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE/tools/brcm /opt/brcm_WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE
    cd /opt
    ln -s /opt/brcm_WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE brcm
</pre>

<p>
Modify your shell environment so that the MIPS cross-compiler is in your
path:

<pre>
    # if you use csh or a variant, add into your ~/.cshrc file after other
    # settings of the path variable:
    set path = ( /opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc/bin $path )

    # if you use bash or a variant, add into your .bashrc file after other
    # settings of your path variable:
    export PATH=/opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc/bin:$PATH
</pre>

<p>
Download the tofu-HyperWRT modifications to the Linksys firmware:

<ul>
    <li>
    With a browser, go to http://www.polarcloud.com/tofu

    <li>
    Download "WRT54G v1-v4, WRT54GL v1.x" source code, a file named
    "tofu-13-c-source.tar.bz2"

    <li>
    Move tofu-13-c-source.tar.bz2 into ~/wrt_dir
</ul>

<p>
Remove some directories from the Linksys firmware that will be replaced
by tofu versions, and unpack the tufo/HyperWRT on top of the Linksys
firmware:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir
    bunzip2 tofu-13-c-source.tar.bz2
    cd WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE/release
    rm -rf src/router/{busybox,udhcpd,dnsmasq,ntpclient,iptables}
    tar xf ~/wrt_dir/HyperWRT_G_tofu13c.tar
</pre>

<p>
Download and unpack the cloud hub application software and cloud hub firmware
modifications:

<ul>
    <li>
    Browse to http://www.sourceforge.net/projects/cloudhub

    <li>
    Hit the big green "Download Cloud Hub" button

    <li>
    Select "Release" cloud_hub_0.1.40

    <li>
    Download the following three files into a convenient directory
    such as ~/wrt_dir:
    <ul>
        <li> cloud_hub_0.1.40.tgz

        <li> cloud_hub_0.1.40_fw.tgz

        <li> cloud_hub_0.1.40_fw.patch
    </ul>
</ul>

<p>
Unpack new cloud hub files into the firmware directory:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE
    tar xfz ~/wrt_dir/cloud_hub_0.1.40.fw.tgz
</pre>

<p>
Apply cloud hub-specific patches to existing files in the firmware directory:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE
    patch -p0 < ~/wrt_dir/cloud_hub_0.1.40_fw.patch
</pre>

<p>
Configure busybox and the linux kernel:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE/release/src/router/busybox
    make menuconfig
    # don't change anything, hit the TAB key to select "exit", and then confirm

    cd ..
    make menuconfig
    # don't change anything, hit the TAB key to select "exit", and then confirm

    # yet another configuration window will be compiled and pop up, and do
    # the same thing again; hit the TAB key to select "exit", and then confirm
</pre>

<p>
Unpack and build the cloud_hub application software and copy
it into the build tree:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir
    tar xfz cloud_hub_0.1.40.tgz
    cd cloud_hub_0.1.40

    # verify that the cross compiler is in your path:
    which mipsel-uclibc-gcc
        /opt/brcm/hndtools-mipsel-uclibc/bin/mipsel-uclibc-gcc
    # if you don't find mipsel-uclibc-gcc, debug your shell path until you do

    make
    copy_um ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE
</pre>

Do the firmware build:

<pre>
    cd ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE/release/src
    make
</pre>

Assuming all goes well, the installable firmware binary will be in
<pre>
    ~/wrt_dir/WRT54GL_4.30.1_1006_DE/release/image/code.bin
</pre>
after the make completes.
